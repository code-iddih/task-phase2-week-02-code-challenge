# Bot Battlr

Welcome to Bot Battlr, the one and only spot in the known universe where you can custom-build your own Bot Army! This project aims to help me practice and implement components, props, state, events, and data fetching in React.

## Learning Goals

Practice using components, props, state, events, and data fetching in React.\
Improve the ability to follow instructions and work within an established codebase.

## Project Overview

In this project, I will develop a React application that displays a list of available bots. The goal is to create a user interface that allows a galactic overlord to browse through the list of robots, view their details, and enlist a bot into their army.

## Features

Browse and view profiles of all bots.\
Add individual bots to the user's army.\
Release bots from the user's army.\
Permanently discharge bots from service.

## Project Guidelines

Use React for building the front-end application.\
Fetch data from the JSON server.\
Implement the application's functionality as per the provided instructions.

## Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

### View Bot Profiles:

See profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection.

### Enlist Bots:

Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the MyBotArmy component. The bot can be enlisted only once. The bot does not disappear from the BotCollection.

### Release Bots:

Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the MyBotArmy component.

### Discharge Bots:

Discharge a bot from their service forever by clicking the red button marked "x". This action deletes the bot both from the backend and from the MyBotArmy on the frontend.

## Technologies Used

React.\
JSON Server.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
